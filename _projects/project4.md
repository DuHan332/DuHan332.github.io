A projects that use random forest to classify data.

Description
------
This is a projects that used Python to implement random forest, which could be used for classification and prediction. It combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. I used it on two datasets about survivor on the Titanic and Amazon reviews.

* Trained random forest to predict if passengers on the Titanic could survive based on Titanic dataset.

* Trained random forest to predict the author of a review on Amazon based on a high dimension dataset about Amazon reviews.

* Conducted bootstrap aggregating technique to improve the stability and accuracy of model.
